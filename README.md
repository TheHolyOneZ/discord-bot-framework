```
docker build -t discord-bot-framework .
```
## 3. Run the container
###    '```--name mybot```' gives a name to the running container. This is not your Python script name.

```

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Clone Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/TheHolyOneZ/discord-bot-framework.git
cd discord-bot-framework
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Create `.env` File

Create `.env` in the root directory:
```env
DISCORD_TOKEN=Bot_Token
BOT_OWNER_ID=Your_DiscordID


# Sharding Configuration
SHARD_COUNT=1

# Can be commented out depending on your needs. If you want to use auto-sharding, leave (SHARD_IDS) commented out. 
# SHARD_IDS=0,1

# Shard Monitor (real-time shard health monitoring)
ENABLE_SHARD_MONITOR=true
SHARD_ALERT_THRESHOLD=3

# Shard Manager (multi-process/multi-server IPC — disabled by default)
ENABLE_SHARD_MANAGER=false
SHARD_IPC_MODE=server
SHARD_IPC_HOST=127.0.0.1
SHARD_IPC_PORT=20000
SHARD_IPC_SECRET=change_me_please
SHARD_CLUSTER_NAME=cluster-0

# Backup & Restore (enabled by default)
ENABLE_BACKUP_RESTORE=true
BACKUP_MAX_PER_GUILD=25
BACKUP_COOLDOWN=300
BACKUP_AUTO_INTERVAL=0
BACKUP_RETENTION_DAYS=0
```

**Getting Your User ID:**
1. Enable Developer Mode: User Settings → Advanced → Developer Mode
2. Right-click your username → Copy ID

**Getting Bot Token:**
1. Go to [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
2. Create New Application
3. Go to Bot section → Reset Token → Copy token

### 4. Configure Bot Intents

In the Discord Developer Portal:
1. Go to your application → Bot section
2. Enable these Privileged Gateway Intents:
   - ✅ Presence Intent
   - ✅ Server Members Intent
   - ✅ Message Content Intent

> **Note:** Server Members Intent is required for the Backup & Restore system to capture member role assignments. Without it, backups will still work but member roles will be empty.

### 5. Run the Bot
```bash
python main.py
```

You should see a Rich console panel with bot statistics!

### 6. Invite Bot to Server

Generate invite URL in Developer Portal:
1. OAuth2 → URL Generator
2. Select Scopes: `bot`, `applications.commands`
3. Select Permissions: Administrator (or specific permissions)
4. Copy generated URL and open in browser

✅ **Search Functionality** - Find extensions by keywords  
✅ **Category Filtering** - Filter by status (Working, Beta, Broken)  
✅ **One-Click Install** - Direct installation to `./extensions` directory  
✅ **License Agreement** - Mandatory acceptance before use  
✅ **ZygnalID System** - Unique bot identification for support  
✅ **Dependency Management** - Automatic missing package installation  
✅ **Version Tracking** - View extension versions and update dates  

### First-Time Setup

1. **Run marketplace command:**
```bash
!marketplace
```

2. **Accept License Agreement:**
   - Read the terms carefully
   - Click "✅ Accept License" button
   - Acceptance is tracked per-user

3. **Browse Extensions:**
   - Use dropdown menu or buttons
   - Search by keywords
   - Filter by categories

### Installing Extensions

**Method 1: Interactive Menu**
```bash
!marketplace
# Click "Browse All" button
# Select extension from dropdown
# Click "📦 Install Extension"
# Confirm installation
```

**Method 2: Direct Install**
```bash
!marketplace install <extension_id>
```

**Post-Installation:**
After successful installation:
```bash
# Load the extension immediately
!load extension_name

# Or reload if already loaded
!reload extension_name

# Or restart bot for auto-load
```

### ZygnalID System

**What is ZygnalID?**
- Unique 16-character identifier for your bot
- Auto-generated on first marketplace use
- Required for extension downloads
- Enables dedicated support and tracking

**View Your ID:**
```bash
!marketplace myid
```
(Owner only, sent via DM for security)

**Activation:**
If your ID is invalid or not activated:
1. Join ZygnalBot Discord: `gg/sgZnXca5ts`
2. Verify yourself
3. Open ticket for "Zygnal ID Activation"
4. Provide your ZygnalID from `!marketplace myid`

### Dependency Management

**Automatic Fix:**
If extensions fail to load due to missing Python packages:
```bash
!marketplace fixdeps
```

This command:
1. Scans `botlogs/current_run.log` for `ModuleNotFoundError`
2. Extracts missing package names
3. Automatically runs `pip install <package>`
4. Reports success/failure per package
5. Provides next steps for loading extensions

**Manual Installation:**
```bash
pip install package_name
!reload extension_name
```

## 🔧 Creating Extensions

### Basic Extension Template
```python
import discord
from discord.ext import commands
from discord import app_commands

class MyExtension(commands.Cog):
    """Description of your extension"""
    
    def __init__(self, bot):
        self.bot = bot
        print(f"{self.__class__.__name__} initialized")
    
    @commands.hybrid_command(
        name="example",
        help="An example command that works with both prefix and slash"
    )
    @commands.cooldown(1, 5, commands.BucketType.user)
    async def example_command(self, ctx):
        """Command implementation"""
        embed = discord.Embed(
            title="✅ Success",
            description="This is an example command!",
            color=0x00ff00
        )
        await ctx.send(embed=embed)
    
    @commands.Cog.listener()
    async def on_message(self, message):
        """Event listener example"""
        if message.author.bot:
            return
        # Your logic here
    
    def cog_unload(self):
        """Cleanup when extension is unloaded"""
        print(f"{self.__class__.__name__} unloaded")

async def setup(bot):
    """Required setup function"""
    await bot.add_cog(MyExtension(bot))
```

### Using Atomic File Operations in Extensions

**Basic File Operations:**
```python
from atomic_file_system import global_file_handler

class MyExtension(commands.Cog):
    async def save_data(self, data: dict):
        # Atomic write with cache invalidation
        success = await global_file_handler.atomic_write_json(
            "./data/my_extension_data.json",
            data,
            invalidate_cache_after=True
        )
        return success
    
    async def load_data(self) -> dict:
        # Read with caching enabled (300s TTL)
        data = await global_file_handler.atomic_read_json(
            "./data/my_extension_data.json",
            use_cache=True
        )
        return data or {}
```

**Advanced Usage with Manual Cache Control:**
```python
class AdvancedExtension(commands.Cog):
    async def update_config(self, key: str, value: str):
        # Read current config (cached)
        config = await global_file_handler.atomic_read_json(
            "./data/config.json",
            use_cache=True
        ) or {}
        
        # Update config
        config[key] = value
        
        # Write and keep in cache (frequent reads)
        await global_file_handler.atomic_write_json(
            "./data/config.json",
            config,
            invalidate_cache_after=False  # Keep in cache
        )
    
    async def force_reload(self):
        # Bypass cache for critical reads
        config = await global_file_handler.atomic_read_json(
            "./data/config.json",
            use_cache=False
        )
        
        # Or manually invalidate cache
        global_file_handler.invalidate_cache("./data/config.json")
```

**Cache Statistics in Extensions:**
```python
class MonitoringExtension(commands.Cog):
    @commands.command()
    async def check_cache(self, ctx):
        stats = global_file_handler.get_cache_stats()
        
        await ctx.send(f"""
        Cache Performance:
        - Size: {stats['cache_size']}/{stats['max_cache_size']}
        - Hit Rate: {stats['hit_rate']}%
        - Total Ops: {stats['total_reads'] + stats['total_writes']}
        - Failures: {stats['write_failures'] + stats['read_failures']}
        """)
```


### Extension with Plugin Metadata
```python
import discord
from discord.ext import commands

# Plugin metadata (recommended for Plugin Registry)
__version__ = "1.0.0"
__author__ = "YourName"
__description__ = "A cool extension that does amazing things"
__dependencies__ = []  # List of required extensions
__conflicts__ = []     # List of incompatible extensions

class MyExtension(commands.Cog):
    def __init__(self, bot):
        self.bot = bot
        
        # Register with Plugin Registry (if available)
        if hasattr(bot, 'register_plugin'):
            bot.register_plugin(
                name="my_extension",
                version=__version__,
                author=__author__,
                description=__description__,
                dependencies=__dependencies__,
                conflicts_with=__conflicts__
            )
    
    @commands.hybrid_command(name="example")
    async def example_command(self, ctx):
        await ctx.send("Hello from my extension!")

async def setup(bot):
    await bot.add_cog(MyExtension(bot))
```

### Using Framework Event Hooks
```python
from discord.ext import commands
import discord

class HookedExtension(commands.Cog):
    def __init__(self, bot):
        self.bot = bot
        
        # Register hooks if Event Hooks system is available
        if hasattr(bot, 'register_hook'):
            # Priority: higher executes first (default: 0)
            bot.register_hook("extension_loaded", self.on_ext_loaded, priority=5)
            bot.register_hook("command_executed", self.on_cmd_used)
            bot.register_hook("bot_ready", self.on_bot_ready)
    
    async def on_ext_loaded(self, bot, extension_name: str, **kwargs):
        """Called when any extension is loaded"""
        print(f"Extension loaded: {extension_name}")
    
    async def on_cmd_used(self, bot, command_name: str, author, **kwargs):
        """Called when any command is executed"""
        print(f"Command {command_name} used by {author}")
    
    async def on_bot_ready(self, bot, bot_user, **kwargs):
        """Called when bot becomes ready"""
        print(f"Bot is ready: {bot_user}")
    
    def cog_unload(self):
        """Cleanup: Unregister hooks when cog unloads"""
        if hasattr(self.bot, 'unregister_hook'):
            self.bot.unregister_hook("extension_loaded", self.on_ext_loaded)
            self.bot.unregister_hook("command_executed", self.on_cmd_used)
            self.bot.unregister_hook("bot_ready", self.on_bot_ready)

async def setup(bot):
    await bot.add_cog(HookedExtension(bot))
```

### Using Database System
```python
from discord.ext import commands
import discord

class DatabaseExtension(commands.Cog):
    def __init__(self, bot):
        self.bot = bot
    
    @commands.hybrid_command(name="savedata")
    async def save_data(self, ctx, key: str, value: str):
        """Save data to guild database"""
        # Get guild-specific database connection
        conn = await self.bot.db._get_guild_connection(ctx.guild.id)
        
        # Create table if not exists
        await conn.execute("""
            CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS custom_data (
                key TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
                value TEXT,
                user_id INTEGER,
                created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
            )
        """)
        
        # Insert or replace data
        await conn.execute(
            "INSERT OR REPLACE INTO custom_data (key, value, user_id) VALUES (?, ?, ?)",
            (key, value, ctx.author.id)
        )
        await conn.commit()
        
        await ctx.send(f"✅ Saved: {key} = {value}")
    
    @commands.hybrid_command(name="getdata")
    async def get_data(self, ctx, key: str):
        """Retrieve data from guild database"""
        conn = await self.bot.db._get_guild_connection(ctx.guild.id)
        
        async with conn.execute(
            "SELECT value, user_id FROM custom_data WHERE key = ?",
            (key,)
        ) as cursor:
            row = await cursor.fetchone()
            
            if row:
                await ctx.send(f"📄 {key} = {row['value']} (saved by <@{row['user_id']}>)")
            else:
                await ctx.send(f"❌ No data found for key: {key}")

async def setup(bot):
    await bot.add_cog(DatabaseExtension(bot))
```

### Integration with Atomic File System

The database system uses the atomic file handler for:
- **Configuration persistence** - `config.json` written atomically
- **Plugin registry storage** - Registry JSON with ACID compliance
- **Framework diagnostics** - Diagnostic reports saved safely
- **Extension data** - Any JSON-based extension storage

**Benefits:**
- Zero data corruption even during crashes
- Concurrent access safety
- Automatic retry on transient failures
- Cache acceleration for frequently accessed files
- Lock-free reads (when cached)

**Performance Optimization:**
```python
# High-frequency reads (use cache)
prefix = await bot.config.get("prefix")  # Cached

# Critical writes (bypass cache)
await bot.config.file_handler.atomic_write_json(
    path, 
    data, 
    invalidate_cache_after=True
)

# Batch operations (manual cache management)
for item in items:
    await process_item(item)
global_file_handler.clear_all_cache()  # Clear after batch
```



### Using Atomic File Operations
```python
from discord.ext import commands
import discord
from atomic_file_system import global_file_handler
from datetime import datetime

### 🗄️ Database System
#### Architecture
The framework uses a hybrid database approach:

1. Main Database (./data/main.db)
  - Global bot statistics
  - Command usage tracking
  - Framework-wide data

2. Per-Guild Databases (./data/[guild_id]/guild.db)
  - Guild-specific settings
  - Custom prefixes
  - Extension data per guild

#### Database Features
✅ WAL Mode - Write-Ahead Logging for concurrent access
✅ Connection Pooling - Automatic per-guild connection management
✅ Automatic Backups - Created on bot shutdown
✅ Orphan Cleanup - Removes connections for left guilds
✅ Atomic Operations - ACID compliance


#### Using the Database
#### Accessing Main Database

```python

# Direct access to main database
async with self.bot.db.conn.execute(
    "SELECT * FROM global_stats WHERE key = ?",
    ("some_key",)
) as cursor:
    row = await cursor.fetchone()
```
#### Accessing Guild Database
```python

# Get guild-specific connection
conn = await self.bot.db._get_guild_connection(guild_id)

# Execute queries
await conn.execute(
    "INSERT INTO custom_table (data) VALUES (?)",
    (data,)
)
await conn.commit()
```
#### Built-in Database Methods
```python

# Set guild prefix
await bot.db.set_guild_prefix(guild_id, "?")

# Get guild prefix
prefix = await bot.db.get_guild_prefix(guild_id)

# Increment command usage
await bot.db.increment_command_usage("command_name")

# Get command statistics
stats = await bot.db.get_command_stats()
# Returns: [(command_name, count), ...]

# Cleanup guild data
await bot.db.cleanup_guild(guild_id)

# Backup databases
await bot.db.backup()  # All guilds
await bot.db.backup(guild_id)  # Specific guild

```



### Database Schema
#### Main Database
global_stats
```

CREATE TABLE global_stats (
    key TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    value TEXT,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
)
```

#### Guild Database
#### guild_settings
```
CREATE TABLE guild_settings (
    key TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    value TEXT,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
)
```
#### command_stats




```
CREATE TABLE command_stats (
    command_name TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    usage_count INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    last_used TIMESTAMP
)
```

### Database Maintenance
#### Automatic Maintenance (Every Hour):

- Cleans up orphaned connections
- Expires prefix cache entries
- Removes pycache directories
- Logs maintenance actions

Manual Cleanup:
```
!cleanup
```
View Database Stats:
```
!dbstats

```


### 📊 Framework Cogs System
#### Overview
**Framework cogs are internal system components that provide core functionality. They're located in ./cogs directory and are automatically loaded on startup (if enabled in config).**


#### Event Hooks System
File: cogs/event_hooks.py

**What It Does**
- Internal event system for framework lifecycle events
- Priority-based callback execution
- Asynchronous queue processing (1000 event capacity)
- Execution history tracking (100 total, 20 per event)
- Worker task for async event processing

#### Available Events: 

### Event Description Table

| Event Name            | Description                       | Parameters                               |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| bot_ready             | Bot becomes ready                 | —                                         |
| guild_joined          | Bot joins a guild                 | guild                                     |

- Automatic cleanup of inactive locks (threshold: 500)
- Lock age tracking for diagnostics
- Deadlock prevention

**Performance Metrics**
- Read/write operation counters
- Cache hit rate calculation
- Failure rate monitoring
- Lock cleanup statistics

**Health Monitoring**
- Real-time failure rate tracking
- Three-tier status: Healthy (<1%), Degraded (1-5%), Critical (>5%)
- Operation history tracking




### Using Atomic File System

**View System Statistics:**
```bash
!atomicstats
```
Shows:
- Cache size and hit rate
- Active file locks
- Total read/write operations
- Failure rates and health status
- System uptime

**Run Diagnostic Tests:**
```bash
!atomictest
```
Performs:
1. Atomic write test
2. Read test without cache
3. Read test with cache (verifies caching)
4. Concurrent write test (10 simultaneous writes)
5. Cache invalidation test

**Performance Metrics:**
- Cache hit rate >70% is healthy
- Active locks should be <100 normally
- Failure rate should be <1%
- Lock cleanup runs automatically at 500+ locks





### Using Event Hooks

**Register a Hook:**
```python
# Register hook with priority
bot.register_hook("bot_ready", my_callback, priority=10)

# Hook callback signature
async def my_callback(bot, **kwargs):
    # bot: Bot instance
    # kwargs: Event-specific parameters
    pass
```

**Hook ID Format:**
- Format: `event_name:callback_name`
- Example: `bot_ready:on_bot_ready`
- Used for disabling/enabling specific hooks

**View Registered Hooks:**
```bash
!eh_list
```
Shows:
- All registered hooks by event
- Priority levels
- Execution counts and failure counts
- Average execution time
- Status indicators:
  - 🔴 - Hook disabled manually
  - ⚠️ - Circuit breaker open
  - No icon - Working normally

**View Execution History:**
```bash
# Last 10 executions
!eh_history

# Last 30 executions
!eh_history 30
```

**Manage Problematic Hooks:**
```bash
# Disable a hook that's causing issues
!eh_disable bot_ready:on_bot_ready

# Re-enable when fixed
!eh_enable bot_ready:on_bot_ready

# Reset circuit breaker (if hook keeps failing)
!eh_reset_circuit command_executed:log_command
```

**Set Alert Channel:**
```bash
# Set current channel
!eh_alert_channel

# Set specific channel
!eh_alert_channel #hook-alerts
```

**Automatic Alerts Sent For:**
- Queue full (dropped events)
- Circuit breaker opens (hook disabled due to failures)
- Worker crashes (with restart attempt count)
- Max restart attempts reached

**Built-in Events:**
- `bot_ready` - Bot becomes ready (kwargs: `bot_user`)
- `guild_joined` - Bot joins guild (kwargs: `guild`)
- `guild_left` - Bot leaves guild (kwargs: `guild`)
- `command_executed` - Command runs (kwargs: `command_name`, `author`, `guild`)
- `command_error` - Command error (kwargs: `command_name`, `error`, `author`, `guild`)

**Custom Events:**
```python
# Emit custom event from your extension
await bot.emit_hook("custom_event", custom_param="value")
```

**Circuit Breaker Behavior:**
1. Hook fails 5 times within 5 minutes
2. Circuit breaker opens (hook disabled)
3. Hook disabled for 60 seconds
4. Automatically closes after timeout
5. Can manually reset with `!eh_reset_circuit`

**Performance Considerations:**
- Each hook has 10-second timeout
- Queue processes sequentially (high-priority first)
- Average execution time tracked per hook
- Slow hooks should be optimized or disabled

**Unregister Hooks:**
```python
# In cog_unload()
bot.unregister_hook("event_name", my_callback)
```

### Using Framework Diagnostics

**View Current Health:**
```bash
!fw_diagnostics
```

**Set Alert Channel:**
```bash
# Set current channel as alert channel
!fw_alert_channel

# Set specific channel
!fw_alert_channel #alerts
```

**What Gets Monitored:**
- **Health Status:**
  - ✅ Healthy: Error rate < 5%
  - ⚠️ Degraded: Error rate 5-9.9%
  - 🚨 Critical: Error rate ≥ 10%

- **System Metrics:**
  - Memory usage (MB)
  - CPU percentage
  - Active threads
  - Open file handles
  - Network connections
  - Event loop lag (ms)

- **Bot Statistics:**
  - Uptime
  - Latency
  - Commands processed
  - Error count
  - Extensions loaded
  - Servers/users/channels

**Automatic Alerts:**
The system automatically sends alerts to your configured channel for:
- Health status changes (degraded/critical)
- Event loop lag above threshold (500ms)
- Repeated diagnostics write failures (3+ consecutive)

**Diagnostics Files:**
- `./data/framework_diagnostics.json` - Complete system snapshot (updated every 5 min)
- `./data/framework_health.json` - Real-time health metrics (updated every 5 min)

**Health Check Frequency:**
- Event loop lag: Every 1 second
- Health monitoring: Every 5 minutes
- Diagnostics generation: Every 5 minutes


### Using Plugin Registry

**List All Plugins:**
```bash
!pr_list
```
Shows all registered plugins with status indicators:
- ✅ - All checks passed
- ⚠️ - Has warnings (conflicts, scan errors)
- ❌ - Missing dependencies
- 🔄 - Circular dependency detected

**View Plugin Details:**
```bash
!pr_info extension_name
```
Shows:
- Version, author, description
- Commands and cogs provided
- Dependencies with version requirements
- Conflict status
- Circular dependency paths (if any)
- Scan errors (if any)

**Validate Plugin:**
```bash
!pr_validate extension_name
```
Checks if a plugin is safe to load by validating:
- All dependencies are met
- No conflicts with loaded plugins
- No circular dependencies

**Toggle Enforcement:**
```bash
# Toggle dependency enforcement
!pr_enforce deps

# Toggle conflict enforcement
!pr_enforce conflicts
```
When enforcement is **enabled** (default):
- Plugins with issues trigger warnings
- Validation errors are logged

When enforcement is **disabled**:
- Plugins load regardless of issues
- Only informational warnings

**Set Alert Channel:**
```bash
# Set current channel
!pr_alert_channel

# Set specific channel
!pr_alert_channel #plugin-alerts
```

**Automatic Alerts Sent For:**
- Plugins loaded with missing dependencies
- Plugins loaded with conflicts
- Extension scan failures
- Circular dependency detection

**Version Requirements:**

In your extension, specify dependencies with versions:
```python
# Supports: >=, >, ==, <=, 
__dependencies__ = {
    "other_extension": ">=1.0.0",
    "another_ext": "==2.5.1"
}
```

**Conflict Declaration:**
```python
# List incompatible extensions
__conflicts__ = ["incompatible_ext", "old_version_ext"]
```

**Registry File:**
- Location: `./data/plugin_registry.json`
- Auto-saved on changes
- Contains all plugin metadata
- Includes enforcement settings

#### Priority System

- Higher priority = executes first
- Default priority: 0
- Range: any integer
- Example: priority=15 runs before priority=10


#### Commands
```
# View registered hooks (Owner only)
!hooks

# View execution history (Owner only)
!hookhistory [limit]
```

**⚠️ IMPORTANT LICENSE NOTICE:**
The Credits tab and visual design of the Live Monitor dashboard are © 2025 TheHolyOneZ and are NOT covered by the MIT license. The Credits section (layout, wording, and SVG crown artwork) MUST remain clearly visible at all times in any use or modification of this dashboard.

---

#### Server Requirements

Live Monitor requires a PHP web server to host the dashboard. Any standard shared hosting works:

| Provider | Notes |
|----------|-------|
| **Strato** | Cheap, reliable German hosting - works great |
| **Hostinger** | Budget-friendly, good performance |
| **Bluehost** | Popular cPanel hosting |
| **Any cPanel host** | Standard PHP hosting works |
| **VPS (Nginx/Apache)** | Full control option |

**Technical Requirements:**
- PHP 7.4 or higher
- SQLite3 PHP extension (usually pre-installed)
- HTTPS strongly recommended
- ~50MB storage for dashboard + data files
- No MySQL/PostgreSQL required (uses SQLite)

---

#### Quick Setup Guide

**Step 1: Run Quickstart Command**
```bash
# Slash command
/livemonitor action:Quick Start (Setup + Files) url:https://yoursite.com/monitor

# Or prefix command
!livemonitor quickstart https://yoursite.com/monitor
```

This generates files in `./live_monitor_website/` folder.

**Step 2: Upload Files to Your Server**

Upload the entire contents of `./live_monitor_website/` to your web server:
```
yoursite.com/monitor/
├── index.php
├── receive.php
├── get_commands.php
├── send_command.php
├── lm_bootstrap.php
├── lm_db.php
├── lm_auth.php
├── setup.php
├── login.php
├── oauth_callback.php
├── logout.php
├── owner_audit.php
├── owner_roles.php
├── owner_db.php
├── backup_dashboard.php
└── assets/
    └── (branding images if present)
```

**Step 3: Claim Your Dashboard**

1. Visit `https://yoursite.com/monitor/setup.php`
2. Enter the **Setup Token** shown in Discord after quickstart
3. This one-time token prevents others from claiming your dashboard
4. You become the Owner with full access

**Step 4: Enable Monitoring**
```bash
/livemonitor action:Enable
# or
!livemonitor enable
```

Your dashboard is now live! Data updates every 2 seconds.

#### Security Best Practices

1. **Use HTTPS** - Tokens are transmitted in URLs
2. **Keep setup token secret** - Only shown once after quickstart
3. **Monitor audit logs** - Check Security tab regularly
4. **Limit Helper access** - Only trusted users
5. **Regular backups** - Use backup feature before major changes

---

#### Troubleshooting

**Dashboard not receiving data:**
- Check `!livemonitor status` for failures
- Verify URL is correct and accessible
- Check PHP error logs on server
- Ensure `receive.php` has write permissions

**Can't claim dashboard:**
- Setup token is one-time use
- Run quickstart again for new token
- Check if `lm_bootstrap.php` exists

**Commands not executing:**
- Check your role has required permissions
- View Security & Logs tab for denied commands
- Verify bot is running and connected

## 📊 Shard Monitor System

### Overview

The Shard Monitor (`cogs/shard_monitor.py`) provides real-time visibility into your bot's shard health, latency, events, and reliability. It features an interactive dashboard with button navigation, automatic health alerts, persistent metrics, and detailed per-shard diagnostics.

**All commands are restricted to the Bot Owner (`BOT_OWNER_ID` from `.env`).** No regular users or guild owners can access shard monitoring data.

### Enabling / Disabling

The Shard Monitor uses a **dual-toggle system**:

1. **`.env` toggle** (takes precedence):
```env
ENABLE_SHARD_MONITOR=true    # Enable the cog
ENABLE_SHARD_MONITOR=false   # Disable the cog completely
```

2. **`config.json` toggle** (secondary):
```json
"framework": {
    "enable_shard_monitor": true
}
```

The cog's `setup()` function checks the `.env` variable first. If disabled, the cog never loads:

```python
async def setup(bot):
    enabled = os.getenv("ENABLE_SHARD_MONITOR", "true").lower()
    if enabled not in ("true", "1", "yes"):
        logger.info("ShardMonitor cog is DISABLED via ENABLE_SHARD_MONITOR env var")
        return
    await bot.add_cog(ShardMonitor(bot))
```

### How It Works

The Shard Monitor runs three background tasks that collect and evaluate data:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                    Shard Monitor Tasks                        │
│                                                              │
│  ┌──────────────┐  ┌──────────────┐  ┌──────────────────┐   │
│  │ collect_     │  │ health_      │  │ save_metrics     │   │
│  │ metrics      │  │ check        │  │                  │   │
│  │ (30s loop)   │  │ (60s loop)   │  │ (5min loop)      │   │

```

### Using the Interactive Dashboard

Run `!shardmonitor` or `/shardmonitor` to get the interactive dashboard:

```bash
!shardmonitor
```

The dashboard displays with **navigation buttons** at the bottom:

- **📊 Overview** — Cluster-wide stats, per-shard summary, alert configuration
- **🏥 Health** — Full health report with critical/warning/healthy breakdown
- **📡 Latency** — Visual latency bars per shard with min/avg/max statistics
- **📈 Events** — Per-shard counters for messages, commands, connects, disconnects, errors
- **🔄 Refresh** — Refresh the current tab with latest data

Only the command author can interact with the buttons (validated via `interaction_check`).

### Detailed Shard Inspection

```bash
# Inspect shard 0 in detail
!sharddetails 0
```

Shows:
- Basic info: guilds, members, current/avg/min/max latency
- Activity: messages processed, commands executed, guild joins/leaves
- Reliability: uptime %, connect/disconnect/reconnect counts
- Errors: total count, consecutive failures, last error details with timestamp
- Connection history: last connect/disconnect timestamps

### Configuring Alerts

```bash
# Set alert channel with custom threshold
!shardalerts #shard-alerts 5

# Disable alerts
!shardalerts
```

Alert configuration persists to `./data/shard_monitor/alert_config.json`:

```json
{
  "alert_channel_id": 1234567890123456789,
  "alert_threshold": 5
}
```

When an unhealthy shard is detected during the 60-second health check cycle, an embed is sent to the configured channel showing the affected shards and their issues.

### Resetting Metrics

```bash
# Reset a specific shard
!shardreset 0

# Reset ALL shards
!shardreset -1
```

### Testing the Shard Monitor

**Step 1 — Single shard (simplest test):**
```env
SHARD_COUNT=1
ENABLE_SHARD_MONITOR=true
```
Start the bot. Wait 30 seconds, then run `!shardmonitor`. You should see shard 0 with health status 🟢.

**Step 2 — Two shards in one process:**
```env
SHARD_COUNT=2
SHARD_IDS=
ENABLE_SHARD_MONITOR=true
```
Now `!shardmonitor` shows two shards. Check latency and guild distribution.

## 🌐 Shard Manager System

### Overview

The Shard Manager (`cogs/shard_manager.py`) enables running your bot's shards across **multiple processes or even different servers**. It provides an IPC (Inter-Process Communication) layer using TCP sockets so separate processes can coordinate, share stats, and communicate.

**All commands are Bot Owner Only.** The cog is **disabled by default** — only enable it when you actually need multi-process sharding.

### When Do You Need This?

| Scenario | Need Shard Manager? |
|----------|---------------------|
| < 2,500 guilds | ❌ No — single process is fine |
| 2,500 - 5,000 guilds | Maybe — if you experience performance issues |
| 5,000+ guilds | ✅ Yes — split across processes |
| Multiple servers/VPS | ✅ Yes — essential for coordination |
| Just want monitoring | ❌ No — use Shard Monitor instead |

Discord **requires** sharding at 2,500 guilds and **recommends** it earlier for larger guilds.

### Architecture

└──────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

- **One cluster runs as `server`** (IPC server mode) — hosts the TCP server
- **Additional clusters run as `client`** — connect to the server
- All clusters exchange stats, health data, and can broadcast messages

### Enabling the Shard Manager

```env
ENABLE_SHARD_MANAGER=true
```

And in `config.json`:
```json
"framework": {
    "enable_shard_manager": true
}
```

### Same-Machine Multi-Process Setup

For a bot with 6 shards split across 2 processes on the **same machine**:

**Process 1 (`.env`):**
```env
DISCORD_TOKEN=your_token
BOT_OWNER_ID=123456789
SHARD_COUNT=6
SHARD_IDS=0,1,2
ENABLE_SHARD_MANAGER=true
SHARD_IPC_MODE=server
SHARD_IPC_HOST=127.0.0.1
SHARD_IPC_PORT=20000
SHARD_IPC_SECRET=my_super_secret_key_123
SHARD_CLUSTER_NAME=cluster-0
```

**Process 2 (`.env.cluster1`):**
```env
DISCORD_TOKEN=your_token
BOT_OWNER_ID=123456789
SHARD_COUNT=6
SHARD_IDS=3,4,5
ENABLE_SHARD_MANAGER=true
SHARD_IPC_MODE=client
SHARD_IPC_HOST=127.0.0.1
SHARD_IPC_PORT=20000
SHARD_IPC_SECRET=my_super_secret_key_123
SHARD_CLUSTER_NAME=cluster-1
```

Start Process 1 first (the server), then Process 2. The client will auto-connect.

### Multi-Server Setup (Different Machines)

Same concept, but change the IPC host:

**Server A (primary):**
```env
SHARD_IPC_MODE=server
SHARD_IPC_HOST=0.0.0.0
SHARD_IPC_PORT=20000
SHARD_IPC_SECRET=very_long_random_secret_here
SHARD_CLUSTER_NAME=us-east-1
SHARD_COUNT=9
SHARD_IDS=0,1,2
```

**Server B (secondary):**
```env
SHARD_IPC_MODE=client
SHARD_IPC_HOST=<Server_A_IP_Address>
SHARD_IPC_PORT=20000
SHARD_IPC_SECRET=very_long_random_secret_here
SHARD_CLUSTER_NAME=us-west-1
SHARD_COUNT=9
SHARD_IDS=3,4,5
```

> ⚠️ **Important:** The `SHARD_IPC_SECRET` **must be identical** on ALL clusters. The server must bind to `0.0.0.0` (not `127.0.0.1`) for remote connections. Ensure the port is open in your firewall.

### IPC Protocol Details

The IPC system uses a **length-prefixed TCP protocol**:

```
┌────────────┬──────────────────────────┐
│ 4 bytes    │ N bytes                  │
│ (uint32 BE)│ (JSON payload)           │
│ = N        │                          │
└────────────┴──────────────────────────┘
```

**Message Types:**

| Operation | Direction | Description |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| `auth` | Client → Server | Authentication with secret + cluster info |
| `auth_response` | Server → Client | Success/failure response |
| `heartbeat` | Client → Server | Keep-alive (every 30s) with guild count |
| `heartbeat_ack` | Server → Client | Heartbeat acknowledgement |
| `stats_broadcast` | Bidirectional | Cluster statistics update (every 60s) |
| `cluster_join` | Server → Clients | New cluster connected notification |
| `cluster_leave` | Server → Clients | Cluster disconnected notification |
| `broadcast_message` | Bidirectional | Text message broadcast from owner |

**Security:**
- Shared secret authentication on every connection
- 1MB max message size, nonce deduplication
- 10-second auth timeout for unauthenticated connections
- No arbitrary code execution — only safe preset queries

### Auto-Reconnection

The IPC client has built-in reconnection with exponential backoff:

| Attempt | Delay |
|---------|-------|
| 1st | 5 seconds |
| 2nd | 10 seconds |
| 3rd | 20 seconds |
| 4th | 40 seconds |
| ... | up to 120 seconds max |

On successful reconnection, the delay resets to 5 seconds.

### Using Cluster Commands

```bash
# View all connected clusters
!clusters

# Check IPC connection diagnostics
!ipcstatus

# Broadcast a message to all clusters
!broadcastmsg Deploying update in 5 minutes
```

`/clusters` shows:
- Per-cluster stats (guilds, users, shards, latency, uptime)
- Connection health indicators (🟢🟡🔴)
- Global totals across all clusters
- IPC server/client status

### Testing the Shard Manager

**Same machine, two processes:**

1. Set up two copies of your bot directory (or use different `.env` files)
2. Configure Process 1 as `server` with `SHARD_IDS=0`, Process 2 as `client` with `SHARD_IDS=1`
3. Start Process 1 first, then Process 2
4. Run `!clusters` on either process — should show both clusters
5. Run `!ipcstatus` to verify the TCP connection
6. Run `!broadcastmsg Hello from cluster-0` to test broadcast

```

### Getting Started

1. **Enable the cog** (enabled by default):
```env
ENABLE_BACKUP_RESTORE=true
```

2. **Create your first backup:**
```
/backupcreate Before server reorganization
```

3. **View the dashboard:**
```
/backup
```

4. **Restore if needed (with selective component toggles):**
```
/backuprestore abc123def456
```

5. **Pin important backups to protect them:**
```
/backuppin abc123def456
```

6. **Set up auto-backups:**
```
/backupschedule enable 24
```

### Permission Model

| User Level | Create | Restore | View | Delete | Pin | Schedule | Diff | Export | Stats |
|-----------|--------|---------|------|--------|-----|----------|------|--------|-------|
| Bot Owner | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Administrator | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ own + admin | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Regular User | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `ENABLE_BACKUP_RESTORE` | `true` | Enable/disable the Backup & Restore cog |
| `BACKUP_MAX_PER_GUILD` | `25` | Maximum backup snapshots per guild |
| `BACKUP_COOLDOWN` | `300` | Seconds between backup creations per guild |
| `BACKUP_AUTO_INTERVAL` | `0` | Hours between auto-backups (0 = disabled, set > 0 to enable scheduler loop) |
| `BACKUP_RETENTION_DAYS` | `0` | Days to keep unpinned backups (0 = keep forever) |

### config.json

```json
"framework": {
    "enable_backup_restore": true
}
```

### Member Role Snapshots

The backup system captures which roles each non-bot member has at backup time. On restore, it reapplies those roles to members who are still in the server.

**Requirements:**
- **Members Gateway Intent** must be enabled in your bot's Developer Portal settings
- Without this intent, member roles will be empty in backups (everything else still works)

**How it works:**
1. During backup: chunks the guild to load all members, saves their non-managed, non-default role IDs and names
2. During restore (safe mode, default): for each member still in the server, adds back roles they're missing
3. During restore (Role Sync ON): adds missing roles AND removes roles the member has now but didn't have at backup time — fully rewinding their roles to the exact backup state
4. Rate-limited at ~2 members/sec to respect Discord API limits

**Role Sync example:**
- Backup state: TheZ1 has `Member, Admin, Helper, HR`
- Current state: TheZ1 has `Member, HR, Noob`
- Safe mode (default): adds `Admin, Helper` back. `Noob` stays.
- Role Sync ON: adds `Admin, Helper` back. Removes `Noob`. TheZ1 is exactly as they were.

### Safety Features

**Abuse Prevention:**
- 5-minute cooldown between backup creations (bot owner gets bypass notification instead of silent skip)
- Maximum 25 backups per guild — delete old ones to free space
- Backup label length limited to 100 characters
- Interaction author verification on all buttons — only the command invoker can interact

**Pin Protection:**
- Pinned backups cannot be deleted manually or by retention cleanup
- Pin/unpin with `/backuppin <id>`

**Restore Protection:**
- Selective component toggles — choose exactly what to restore
- **Role Sync mode** (off by default) — destructive mode that removes roles not in backup. Protected behind explicit toggle.
- Two-step confirmation dialog with danger-colored button
- Restore only creates missing items — never deletes existing ones
- Per-guild restore lock prevents concurrent restore operations
- Real-time progress updates during restore
- Detailed error reporting if any items fail to create

**Data Integrity:**
- SHA-256 checksum stored per backup, verifiable with `/backupverify`
- Atomic file system integration prevents corruption during writes
- Individual snapshot files with UUID-based IDs

**Timezone Handling:**
- All timestamps stored as UTC-aware ISO 8601 strings
- Discord's `<t:epoch:R>` formatting displays correctly in every user's local timezone
- Backward-compatible with legacy naive timestamps from older backup versions

### Restore Behavior

The restore engine is non-destructive and selective. It compares the backup snapshot against the current guild state and only creates items that are missing:

| Scenario | Behavior |
|----------|----------|
| Role exists (by name) | Skipped — existing role kept |
| Role missing | Created with backed-up permissions, color, and settings |
| Channel exists (by name) | Skipped — existing channel kept |
| Channel missing | Created with backed-up topic, slowmode, overwrites, and category |
| Category exists (by name) | Skipped — existing category kept |
| Category missing | Created with backed-up permission overwrites |
| Member still in server | Missing roles from backup are re-applied |
| Member still in server (Role Sync ON) | Roles fully rewound: missing roles added, extra roles removed |
| Member left server | Skipped — cannot apply roles to absent members |
| Bot prefix in backup | Restored to guild database with cache invalidation |
| Mention prefix setting | Restored to guild database |

### Testing

1. Run `/backup` to open the dashboard — explore all 5 tabs
2. Run `/backupcreate Test backup` to create a snapshot
3. Run `/backupview <id>` to inspect it — check member role count
4. Run `/backup` → Compare tab to see drift analysis
5. Delete a test channel, then run `/backuprestore <id>` to restore it
6. Verify the channel was recreated with correct settings and permissions
7. Run `/backuppin <id>` to protect important backups
8. Run `/backupverify <id>` to confirm integrity
9. Run `/backupdiff <id_a> <id_b>` to compare two backups

## 🛠 Troubleshooting

### Bot Won't Start

**Error: `DISCORD_TOKEN not found in .env!`**

Solution:
1. Create `.env` file in root directory
2. Add: `DISCORD_TOKEN=your_token_here`
3. Ensure no quotes around token
4. Ensure file is named `.env` not `.env.txt`

**Error: `BOT_OWNER_ID not found in .env!`**

Solution:
1. Add to `.env`: `BOT_OWNER_ID=your_user_id`
2. Get ID by enabling Developer Mode in Discord
3. Right-click your username → Copy ID

**Error: `discord.ext.commands.errors.ExtensionFailed`**

Solution:
1. Check logs: `cat botlogs/current_run.log`
2. Look for syntax errors in extension
3. Ensure all imports are available
4. Use `!marketplace fixdeps` for missing packages

### Atomic File System Issues

**High Cache Miss Rate (<50%):**

Solution:
1. Check if files are being modified externally
2. Verify cache TTL isn't too short (default: 300s)
3. Run `!atomicstats` to view statistics
4. Consider increasing `max_cache_size` in code

**Many Active Locks (>100):**

Solution:
1. Check `!atomicstats` for lock count
2. Locks cleanup automatically at 500 threshold
3. Restart bot if locks are permanently stuck
4. Review code for proper async/await usage

**Write Failures:**

Solution:
1. Check file permissions in `./data` directory
2. Ensure sufficient disk space
3. Verify no external process is locking files
4. Check `!atomicstats` for failure patterns
5. Review logs for specific error messages

**Cache Not Invalidating:**

Solution:
```python
# Manual invalidation in code
global_file_handler.invalidate_cache("./data/problematic_file.json")

# Or clear all cache
global_file_handler.clear_all_cache()
```

**Performance Degradation:**

Solution:
1. Check `!atomicstats` for health status
2. If failure rate >5%, check disk I/O
3. Monitor lock count (should be <50 normally)
4. Run `!atomictest` to verify system health
5. Consider restarting bot if critical

### Extensions Not Loading

**Check logs:**
```bash
# Linux/Mac
cat botlogs/current_run.log | grep -i "extension"

# Windows
findstr /i "extension" botlogs\current_run.log
```

**Common Issues:**

1. **Missing `setup` function**
```python
   # Required in every extension
   async def setup(bot):
       await bot.add_cog(YourCog(bot))
```

2. **Syntax errors**
   - Check Python syntax
   - Ensure proper indentation
   - Validate imports

3. **Extension in blacklist**
   - Check `config.json` → `extensions.blacklist`
   - Remove extension name from list

4. **File not in `extensions/` directory**
   - Move file to `./extensions/`
   - Ensure `.py` extension

5. **Spaces in filename**
   - Framework auto-renames to underscores
   - Use `!load extension_name` (with underscores)

6. **Missing dependencies**
   - Use `!marketplace fixdeps`
   - Or manual: `pip install package_name`

### Slash Commands Not Syncing

**Manual sync:**
```bash
!sync
```

**Rate Limiting:**
- Discord limits syncs to ~2 per hour
- Bot automatically waits and retries
- Check logs for retry messages
- Wait 1 hour if rate limited

**Slash Command Limit Reached:**
```bash
# Check current usage
!slashlimit

# If at limit (100 commands):
# - New extensions become prefix-only
# - Existing slash commands still work
# - Unload unused extensions to free slots
```

**Verification:**
```bash
# Check registered commands
!extensions

# View slash command count
!stats
```

### Database Errors

**Error: `database is locked`**

Solution:
1. Ensure only one bot instance running
2. Wait for WAL checkpoint to complete
3. Restart bot if persists

**Backup and Reset:**
```bash
# Backup current database
cp data/main.db data/main.db.backup
cp -r data/[guild_id] data/[guild_id].backup

# Delete database (will regenerate)
rm data/main.db
rm -rf data/[guild_id]

# Restart bot
python main.py
```

**Check Database Stats:**
```bash
!dbstats
```

### Permission Errors

**"Missing Permissions" error:**

Solution:
1. Check bot has required Discord permissions
2. Verify role hierarchy (bot role above target roles)
3. Enable necessary intents in Developer Portal
4. Check bot permissions in channel settings

**"You don't have permission" error:**

Solution:
1. Check command permissions: `!config`
2. Verify your roles match requirements
3. Contact bot owner for access
4. Check if command is owner-only

### Memory/Performance Issues

**High Memory Usage:**

Solution:
1. Run `!cleanup` to clear caches
2. Check `!cachestats` for large caches
3. Reduce cache TTL in `atomic_file_system.py`
4. Restart bot periodically

**Slow Command Response:**

Solution:
1. Check `!stats` for latency
2. View `!dbstats` for connection issues
3. Run `!integritycheck` for system health
4. Check database file sizes
5. Consider sharding for large bots

### Marketplace Issues

**"Invalid or not activated" ZygnalID:**

Solution:
1. Get ID: `!marketplace myid` (Owner only)
2. Join ZygnalBot Discord: `gg/sgZnXca5ts`
3. Verify yourself in server
4. Open ticket for "Zygnal ID Activation"
5. Provide your ZygnalID in ticket

**Extension Install Failed:**

Solution:
1. Check error message for details
2. Verify bot has write permissions to `./extensions`
3. Ensure sufficient disk space
4. Try `!marketplace refresh`
5. Check logs: `botlogs/current_run.log`

**Missing Dependencies After Install:**

Solution:
```bash
# Automatic fix
!marketplace fixdeps

# Manual fix
pip install package_name
!reload extension_name
```

### Hot-Reload Not Working

**Issue:** File changes not detected

Solution:
1. Check `config.json` → `auto_reload: true`
2. Ensure file in `./extensions` directory
3. Wait 30 seconds for check cycle
4. Use manual reload: `!reload extension_name`
5. Check logs for reload errors

### Shard Monitor Issues

**Cog doesn't load:**

Solution:
1. Check `.env` has `ENABLE_SHARD_MONITOR=true`
2. Check `config.json` has `"enable_shard_monitor": true`
3. Verify the file exists at `cogs/shard_monitor.py`
4. Check logs: `grep "ShardMonitor" botlogs/current_run.log`

**No metrics showing / "No activity" warnings:**

Solution:
1. Wait 30+ seconds after startup for first collection cycle
2. The 5-minute inactivity threshold may trigger on low-traffic bots
3. Run `!shardreset -1` to reset all metrics and start fresh

**Alerts not firing:**

Solution:
1. Verify alert channel is set: `!shardalerts #channel`
2. Check `./data/shard_monitor/alert_config.json` exists
3. Ensure bot has Send Messages permission in the alert channel
4. Wait for the 60-second health check cycle

### Shard Manager Issues

**Cog doesn't load:**

Solution:
1. Check `.env` has `ENABLE_SHARD_MANAGER=true`
2. Note: it's disabled by default (`false`)

**"Auth failed" when connecting:**

Solution:
1. Verify `SHARD_IPC_SECRET` is **identical** on all clusters
2. Check for trailing whitespace in the `.env` value
3. Ensure the server cluster is running before starting clients

**Can't connect from another machine:**

Solution:
1. Server must use `SHARD_IPC_HOST=0.0.0.0` (not `127.0.0.1`)
2. Check firewall allows port `SHARD_IPC_PORT` (default: 20000)
3. Verify the client's `SHARD_IPC_HOST` points to the server's IP address
4. Check logs for connection errors: `grep "IPC" botlogs/current_run.log`

**"Using default secret" warning:**

Solution:
Set a proper secret in `.env`:
```env
SHARD_IPC_SECRET=my_long_random_secret_string_here
```

**Cluster shows 🔴 (disconnected):**

Solution:
1. Check if the remote process is still running
2. Heartbeat timeout is 120 seconds — wait and check again
3. Check network connectivity between machines
4. Client auto-reconnects with exponential backoff (5s → 120s)

### Help Menu Issues

**Commands not showing:**

Solution:
1. Check command has `help` parameter
2. Ensure command not marked `hidden=True`
3. Verify cog loaded: `!extensions`
4. Check command registered: `!stats`

**Dropdown not working:**

Solution:
1. Ensure only command requester can use menu
2. Check view hasn't timed out (180s)
3. Verify bot has "Use Application Commands" permission
4. Try rerunning command

### Backup & Restore Issues

**Backup creation fails:**

Solution:
1. Check `./data/backups/` directory has write permissions
2. Verify you haven't hit the 25-backup limit: `/backup` → Overview tab
3. Wait for cooldown to expire (5 minutes between backups)
4. Check bot logs for `BackupRestore:` error messages

**Restore not creating items:**

Solution:
1. Restore only creates **missing** items — it skips existing roles/channels by name
2. Ensure bot has **Administrator** permission in the server
3. Ensure bot's role is **above** the roles it needs to create in the role hierarchy
4. Check the results embed for "Skipped" and "Failed" counts

**Permission denied on backup commands:**

Solution:
1. Backup commands require **Administrator** permission or **Bot Owner** status
2. `/backupexport` is restricted to Bot Owner only
3. Non-admin users cannot delete backups they didn't create
4. Ensure the command is not disabled in `config.json` (`enable_backup_restore: false`)

**Backup data directory not found:**

Solution:
1. The `./data/backups/` directory is auto-created on first use
2. Check filesystem permissions for the bot process
3. Verify the atomic file system is working: `!atomictest`

## 📈 Performance Tips

### Atomic File System Optimization

**Cache Strategy:**
```python
# Frequently read files - USE cache
config = await global_file_handler.atomic_read_json(
    "config.json",
    use_cache=True  # Fast repeated reads
)

# Rarely read files - BYPASS cache
log_data = await global_file_handler.atomic_read_json(
    "large_log.json",
    use_cache=False  # Don't pollute cache
)

# After bulk updates - CLEAR cache
await process_many_files()
global_file_handler.clear_all_cache()
```

**Lock Optimization:**
```python
# Bad: Multiple separate operations
for file in files:
    data = await read_file(file)
    await write_file(file, process(data))

# Good: Batch operations
all_data = {}
for file in files:
    all_data[file] = await read_file(file)

for file, data in all_data.items():
    await write_file(file, process(data))
```

**Monitoring Health:**
```bash
# Regular health checks
!atomicstats  # View overall health

# Performance testing
!atomictest   # Verify operation speeds
```

**Best Practices:**
1. Use cache for config files (read-heavy)
2. Bypass cache for log files (write-heavy)
3. Invalidate cache after critical writes
4. Monitor failure rate (should be <1%)
5. Run cleanup during low-activity periods

### Database Optimization

**Use Transactions for Bulk Operations:**
```python
async with bot.db.conn.execute("BEGIN"):
    for item in items:
        await bot.db.conn.execute(
            "INSERT INTO table VALUES (?)",
            (item,)
        )
    await bot.db.conn.commit()
```

**Index Frequently Queried Columns:**
```python
await conn.execute(
    "CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_user_id ON my_table(user_id)"
)
```

**Use LIMIT for Large Queries:**
```python
async with conn.execute(
    "SELECT * FROM large_table LIMIT 100"
) as cursor:
    rows = await cursor.fetchall()
```

### File Operations

**Use Caching for Read-Heavy Operations:**
```python
# Enable caching (300s TTL)
data = await global_file_handler.atomic_read_json(
    filepath,
    use_cache=True
)
```

**Disable Caching for Real-Time Data:**
```python
data = await global_file_handler.atomic_read_json(
    filepath,
    use_cache=False
)
```

**Batch File Operations:**
```python
# Bad: Multiple writes
for item in items:
    await global_file_handler.atomic_write_json(f"data/{item}.json", item_data)

# Good: Single write
combined_data = {item: item_data for item in items}
await global_file_handler.atomic_write_json("data/all_items.json", combined_data)
```

### Discord API

**Batch Messages:**
```python
# Bad: Individual messages
for user in users:
    await channel.send(f"Hello {user}")

# Good: Single message
await channel.send(f"Hello {', '.join(str(u) for u in users)}")
```

**Use Embeds for Rich Content:**
```python
# Embeds are more efficient than multiple messages
embed = discord.Embed(title="Data")
for key, value in data.items():
    embed.add_field(name=key, value=value)
await channel.send(embed=embed)
```

**Cache Guild/Member Data:**
```python
# Use intents to cache data
intents = discord.Intents.all()

# Access cached data (no API call)
member = guild.get_member(user_id)
```

### Extension Loading

**Blacklist Unused Extensions:**
```json
{
    "extensions": {
        "blacklist": ["debug_cog", "test_extension"]
    }
}
```

**Profile Extension Load Times:**
```python
# View load times
!extensions

# Check diagnostics
!diagnostics
```

### Memory Management

**Regular Cleanup:**
```bash
# Run periodically
!cleanup
```

**Monitor Cache Usage:**
```bash
!cachestats
```

**Limit Background Tasks:**
```python
# Increase interval for non-critical tasks
@tasks.loop(hours=6)  # Instead of minutes=5
async def background_task(self):
    pass
```

### Sharding

For bots in 2000+ guilds:
```.env
# Basic sharding (single process, multiple shards)
SHARD_COUNT=2
SHARD_IDS=0,1
```

**Enable shard monitoring for visibility:**
```.env
ENABLE_SHARD_MONITOR=true
```

**For large bots (5000+ guilds), use multi-process sharding:**
```.env
# Process 1: shards 0-2
SHARD_COUNT=6
SHARD_IDS=0,1,2
ENABLE_SHARD_MANAGER=true
SHARD_IPC_MODE=server
SHARD_IPC_SECRET=your_secret
SHARD_CLUSTER_NAME=cluster-0

# Process 2: shards 3-5
SHARD_COUNT=6
SHARD_IDS=3,4,5
ENABLE_SHARD_MANAGER=true
SHARD_IPC_MODE=client
SHARD_IPC_SECRET=your_secret
SHARD_CLUSTER_NAME=cluster-1
```

**Benefits:**
- Distributes load across processes
- Reduces per-process memory
- Improved stability
- Better rate limit handling
- Cross-shard stat aggregation via IPC
- Automatic health monitoring and alerts

**Monitoring Commands:**
```bash
!shardmonitor    # Interactive dashboard
!shardhealth     # Quick health check
!clusters        # View all clusters (requires Shard Manager)
```
