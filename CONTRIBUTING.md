## üíª Coding Standards

### Python Style

- Follow PEP 8 guidelines
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add docstrings to functions and classes
- Keep functions focused and concise
- Use type hints where appropriate

### Example:

```python
async def example_command(ctx, user: discord.Member, reason: str = "No reason provided"):
    """
    Example command that demonstrates proper formatting.
    
    Args:
        ctx: The command context
        user: The member to target
        reason: Optional reason string
    """
    await ctx.send(f"Action taken on {user.mention}: {reason}")
```

### Code Organization

- Place extension files in the `extensions/` folder
- Use cogs for organizing related commands
- Keep `main.py` focused on core bot functionality
- Create helper functions for repeated code

### Comments

- Comment complex logic
- Use inline comments sparingly
- Prefer clear code over excessive comments
- Document why, not what
